🚀 Road Accident Data Analysis 🚀<br>
 🌟<br>

🔍 Dataset:
I worked on a detailed road accident dataset that covered multiple factors like:<br>

Day of the week 🗓️<br>
Hour of the day ⏰<br>
Weather conditions 🌧️<br>
Light conditions 🌘<br>
Vehicle types 🚗<br>
Road surface conditions 🛣️<br>
🔧 Operations: I carried out comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and uncover key patterns:<br>

Identified accident peaks during weekends and rush hours 📊<br>
Analyzed the role of weather, road conditions, and vehicle types 🚦<br>
Extracted actionable insights from multiple-vehicle and severity trends 🚑<br>
🎯 Outcome: The results revealed critical accident trends like the vulnerability of motorcycles, the impact of poor weather, and accident severity in rural vs. urban areas. These insights will guide better safety strategies, improve road infrastructure, and reduce accident rates. 💡
